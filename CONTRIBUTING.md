The aim of the library is to explore ways to use symbolic reasoning with machine learning.
I am very interested in the **Neuro-Symbolic AI** field and I developed this library aiming at discovering ways to
combine AI with its modern approaches using Neural Networks and the GOFAI Symbolic AI. 

Contribution, new ideas, collaboration and any kind of help will be much appreciated.
